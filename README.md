Barcode Scanner & Inventory Tracker is a simple barcode scanner with additional inventory tracking capabilities. This application allows you to scan barcodes and retrieve information such as name of the product, picture or even the price of the product and links to stores online that sell the item. You can also store your searches with inventory information. This application does require internet connection to retrieve the data from searchupc.com servers. This application is not a product by searchups.com, merely it uses their API. The images do not represent the application because the application does not run on an emulator properly.
